########Promises 

A Promise represents an outcome of an outcome
which will happen sometime in the futurw and we dont know
when that operation will be going to complete.

the outcome is known to us. and if its successfully returns 
that means the promise is fullfilled


here we use callback function where we use resolve and 
reject fucntions as parameters. resolve is used when the promise is 
fullfilled and reject if its not.

let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject)) =>{

    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(10_000)
     } , 3000 ) //represents two days
}
