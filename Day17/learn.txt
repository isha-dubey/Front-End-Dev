---------------IFFE------------

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a 
JavaScript design pattern that involves creating a function
 expression and immediately invoking it. It allows you to create
  a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global scope.

Here's the basic structure of an IIFE:

(function() {
  // Your code goes here
})();



in main.js


let publicprops = (function () {

    let publicVariable = 10
    let privateVariable = 20
    return {
        value : publicVariable
    }
})()

console.log(publicprops)

in anotherfile.js

console.log(publicprops.value)


<!-- // how the files are placed is very important in javascript (upar niche na ho) -->
<!-- // also know as object revealing pattern , we only showed publicVariable hiding the other -->



We can do this is in more better way in ES6 with the hekp of modules we can do this module thing
modules allow us to structure our code and share the class with other files 

syntax -- <script type="module" src="main.js">  </script>

Let say we have two variables and two js files one with declaration and another with execution

in main.js--------

console.log(publicVariable , privateVariable)

in somefile.js -----------

let publicVariable=10
let privateVariable = 20

In order to share these files we have to load these 
variables with one another we have to load it in html.
if we want to export something it can be a variable or functionand if some
wants to consume the functionality that you are using they can use with import function


since we want to export the variable we will use somefile.js


export let publicVariable = 10
let privateVariable = 20

in main.js------------------

import {publicVariable} from "./somefile.js"
console.log (publicVariable)


-----these  exports we learned are main exports , the another type of export we learn is default exports

in somefile.js

function defaultExport(){
  console.log('default export')

}

in main.js-----

import abc from "./somefile.js


for default Exports you dont nedd to use the curly brackets and you cn name it any thing
we can aslo use default export and name export together

ex-   import defaultExport , {publicVariable} from "./somefile.js"


difference is you can have one default export but multiple name exports

another way of using import function is that instead of writing it in front 
of the variable . we can use it like this

export {publicVariable} at the bottom of the code
