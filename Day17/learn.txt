---------------IFFE------------

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a 
JavaScript design pattern that involves creating a function
 expression and immediately invoking it. It allows you to create
  a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global scope.

Here's the basic structure of an IIFE:

(function() {
  // Your code goes here
})();
