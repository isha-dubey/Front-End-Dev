                // Numbers:
                let length = 16;
                let weight = 7.5;

                // Strings:
                let color = "Yellow";
                let lastName = "Johnson";

                // Booleans
                let x = true;
                let y = false;

                // Object:
                const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

                // Array object:
                const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

                // Date object:
                const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
                let currentDate = new Date();
                Accessing Date Components:  
                                let year = currentDate.getFullYear();
                                let month = currentDate.getMonth(); // Note: Months are zero-based (0 = January, 11 = December)
                                let day = currentDate.getDate();

If you want to keep the original Date object unchanged and create a new Date object with the modified date,
// Create the original Date object
let originalDate = new Date(); // current date and time

// Create a new Date object based on the original
let modifiedDate = new Date(originalDate);

// Make changes to the new Date object
modifiedDate.setFullYear(2022);
modifiedDate.setMonth(5); // June (zero-based)
modifiedDate.setDate(15);

// Display both the original and modified dates
console.log("Original Date:", originalDate);
console.log("Modified Date:", modifiedDate);




//////When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

                                        #Variables

///// Variables are of dynamic type in js meaning that a
     string can be converted into a boolean or a number  

 ### Declaration   var foo = "isha" or let foo="isha"  or Const a=10
 # Const is use for value that you dont wanna change throughout

###    Whenever you are assigning a variable and not assigning
       any value to it its initially value is undefined                          


### NaN (not a number) is another datatype that comes when you add two diff datatypes
### Symbol
### Big int


        ## For creating custom data types we use objects 
        ## Let person = {fristName: "Isha", Age:30}

if we want to add new data / data type to it 
we will use ### person.islearningfrontend = true;

## you cant redeclare using let and const but you can with var

{
    let x=1o  #you can not access this outside the block with let keyword but with var you can
}

                            ### Operators

    ## Aissgnment Operator (=)
    ## // Assign the value 5 to x
          let x = 5;
///
Arithmetic Operators --> + , - , * , **{exponential} , / {divsion} , % {modulus}
Assignment Operators --> = , += , -=
Comparison Operators --> =={equal to} , ==={equal to and type} , != {not equal} , < , >
String Operators  --> {Comparison ops can be used for string} , + can be used to add two strings
Logical Operators  --> &&{logical and} || {logical or} ! logical not
Bitwise Operators
Ternary Operators --> (condition) ? "...." : "else"
Type Operators ////


            ### TYpe conversion
                - num1.toString()
                - parseInt("value") into integer

            ### length of any string
            a = "isha"
            a.length
            .charAt {jaha pe bhi char h}

    ###Flow Statements

#if else Statements
   ////
     if (num1 > num2 ){ 
        console.log(num1 + "is greater than " + num2); 
      }
     else if { console.log( "not true");}
     else {
        console.log("ok");
     }

   ////num1 > num2 ? " 1 is greater thn 2" : "nothing"

   # Switch cases
   (alternative of if/else)
   switch(num)
    {
        case 1:  console.log ("sunday"); 
                break;  
        case 2: console.log("tuesday"); 
                break;
         default: console.log("invalid");
     }

                ####loops

--> while
while (condition is true)
        {// do something}; increment

     ////
     let index = 0
        while (index <=10) {
    console.log(index); index++}

--> Do while

    //do something
    console.log(index);
    index++;
 } while (index <=10)
                            ////the loop is atleast runne once in do while kyuki
                                condition baad me check krta while loop me phele check krta condition

---> For
 for (let index=1 ; index<=10 ; index++)
   {console.log(index);}

                        ###ARRAys
    
    -allows collection of similar datatypes
    -  const fruits=["apple", "anana" , "kiwi"]
      
      /// to modify
        fruits[1] = "date"
      ///
      an array can have different data types

      ///
      using loop
      let sum=0

            numbers.push(11)
            numbers.pop(2)

      1. Write a JavaScript program that displays the largest integer among two integers.


---> let a = 5
     let b = 6
     if (a > b){ console.log(` ${a} is the largest number`)}
     else if (b > a){ consoloe.log(`${b} is the largest number)}
     else {console.log("a and b are equal")}

2. Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign of the product of three numbers. Display an alert box with the specified sign.
Sample numbers : 3, -7, 2
Output : The sign is -

var x=3;
var y=-7;
var z=2;
if (x>0 && y>0 && z>0)
{
       alert("The sign is +");
}
else if (x<0 && y<0 && z<0)
        {
          console.log("The sign is -");
        }
        else if (x>0 && y<0 && z<0)
        {
          console.log("The sign is +");
        }
        else if (x<0 && y>0 && z<0)
        {
          console.log("The sign is +");
        }
        else
        {
          console.log("The sign is -");
        }

6. Write a JavaScript program that computes the average marks of the following students. Then, this average is used to determine the corresponding grade.

Student Name	Marks
David	80
Vinoth	77
Divya	88
Ishitha	95
Thomas	68
The grades are computed as follows :

Range	Grade
<60	F
<70	D
<80	C
<90	B
<100	A

7. Write a JavaScript program that iterates integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

8. According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process :
"Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)".
Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers.

9. Write a JavaScript program to find the Armstrong numbers of 3 digits.
Note : An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.
