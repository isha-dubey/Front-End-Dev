##CSS GRID

So css grid is basically used to make better the use of css better. 
it includes rows and coloumns grids areas in which we can give space to the divs according to our needs.

considering an example -

->>> Create 5 divs , each with the class="item" . put the

Display : grid ;

Use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows for giving the 
size of rows and columns

grid-template-columns : 200px 40rem 30%
grid-template-rows : 300px , 40%
grid-auto-rows : 300px;  // we automatically give it to every rows
grid-auto-columns : 

--->> Fews more properties to use in display -> grid

gap:
justify-content :
place-content :
align-content :


---> If you have fixed size of rows and columns then it will
    not be responsive to make it responsive you have to give same 
    size to each coloumn (for eg 1fr)

---> Justify-items and justify-content are two differrent properties
     items meaning that jo bhi item suppose "isha" , toh isha jitna 
     space lera sirf usko justify krega
     but in content vo box ko justify krega

---> suppose we want to have first item to have the space of 
    two items so we would this new property 

    item(isko space dena hai) {
        grid-coloumn : span 2 ;
    }

    value of span it default set to one.

     Lexical Environment is the internal JS engine construct that holds 
     identifier-variable mapping


.......> hoisting
        declaring a variable before using it (not done in most of the languges)
        It will say undefined and no error will occur

        this happens because of execution context 

        it works in two phases - creation phase and executio phase

        creation phase me code read krtae aur uski memory me space bana leta hai

        an then phir execution phase me line by line read krtae

----->every time a fucnction is created a new execution context is created

........> Scope chain means ek particular chiz ka kitna scope hai

        we should generally use let and const variable
