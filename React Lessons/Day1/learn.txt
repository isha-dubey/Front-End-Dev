#INTERPOLATION 
In React, interpolation refers to the process of
embedding dynamic values or expressions within JSX. It involves using curly 
braces {} to wrap JavaScript expressions or variables, allowing you to inject 
dynamic content into your JSX code.

const App = () => {
  const name = 'John';

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
};



In React, when we talk about "expressions" in the context of interpolation,
we mean that the content within the curly braces {} should evaluate to a 
single value. In contrast, "statements" represent a set of instructions or 
actions that may involve multiple steps and do not directly produce a value.

In JSX, we use curly braces to embed JavaScript expressions, and these expressions 
should result in a single value. For example:

jsx
Copy code
const number = 5;

// This is an expression
<p>The square of {number} is {number * number}.</p>
Here, {number * number} is an expression that evaluates to a single valueâ€”the 
square of the number. Expressions are used to inject dynamic content into the JSX markup.

Now, let's discuss why statements are not allowed directly within JSX:

JSX Is Not JavaScript:
JSX looks similar to JavaScript, but it's actually a syntactic sugar for 
React.createElement calls. It is not a full-fledged JavaScript runtime. When 
you use JSX, it gets transpiled into JavaScript code by tools like Babel. 
Statements (which include control flow statements like if, for, etc.) are not 
valid expressions that can be directly embedded in JSX.

JSX and JavaScript Interoperability:
JSX is designed to work seamlessly with JavaScript expressions to maintain 
simplicity and readability. Allowing statements within JSX could complicate 
the translation process and make it less predictable.

However, you can use expressions that involve ternary operators or immediately 
invoked function expressions (IIFE) to achieve conditional logic or execute multiple 
statements indirectly within JSX:
