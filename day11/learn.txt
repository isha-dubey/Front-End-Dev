##Default values in Js 

....> functions usually have default values for parameters
    when you dont give any parameter to function it sets in as undefeined

## Ways of creating an object

....> Object literal Syntax 
        let person = {
            firstname : "isha" ,
            lastname : "doe"
        }

....> By object() function

    let anotherPerson = new object();
    anotherPerson.firstname = "isha"
    anotherPerson.lastname = "dubey"
    console.log (anotherPerson)

.....> function Constructor

    function person(){
      this.firstname = "jane"
      this.lastname = "doe"
    }
    let jane = new Person();
    console.log(jane)

## Prototype 

All the javascript objects inhrits the properties and methods from prototype.

such type of inheritance is called prototypal inheritance

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

 The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, 
 making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype\
  that has null for its own prototype.


### Object.create()

Normally if we use object literal syntax and then delete any value from it it will be delted
from its protto also. but if we use object.create we can not delte any value cause its permanently stored
in it.

let obj = object.create(){

    fname: Isha ,
    Lname: Dubey
}
delete obj.Lname
console.log(obj.Lname)
